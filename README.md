# ðŸ‘‹ Hello from Brooklyn!

I'm a software engineer with a focus on web development. Over the course of my decade-long career on the web, I've directed myself at projects and teams that enable creatives to do their best work. I've worked extensively with TypeScript and React, and have experience building desktop applications using tools like Electron. I enjoy learning and applying concepts from functional programming in web contexts, and I'm actively exploring Rust. I am passionate about the Local-first movement as part of the future of software.

In my free time, I'm also a community organizer for the open source TypeScript project [zod](colinhacks/zod), where I help maintain and improve the library and support its vibrant user community.

I'm also interested in exploring new ways of organizing and governing open source projects and digital product development teams. I believe in the power of horizontal organization, social collaboration, and co-creation to build better products and a better future for ourselves as technical creatives and the world that we're building.
